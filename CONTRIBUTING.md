Adding an applet: 

<pre>
wget https://github.com/isdrupter/busybotnet/blob/master/add-applet.bash
bash add-applet.bash
make clean
make defconfig
make
</pre>

or something like that


We need people to update this code. Seriously, pull new busybox source and re-add everything. It's getting to be that time.
